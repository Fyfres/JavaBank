# JavaBank

Project done in a Formation  
I started learning Java 3 weeks before finishing the "V3"  

## What did i learn  
  
How to use abstract class and methods  
How to use implements  
How to use Swing (at least a little)    
How to save datas in files  
How to use JDBC (not in this repo because it wasn't fully implemented i just made some testing)  
Learned a bit about how to use Threads  

## Was it cool to do 

At first i liked it but i had to add things again and again while learning some things so i don't like how it look, now with how i see things this project seems really bad.
At least i learned and that's what's important.
