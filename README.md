# JavaBank

Project done in a Formation  
I started learning Java 3 weeks before finishing the "V3"  

## What did i learn  
  
How to use abstract class and methods  
How to use implements  
How to use Swing (at least a little)  
And the rest wasn't really "learning", it was really basic since i already had bases of Object Oriented Programation  

## Was it cool to do 

At first i liked it but i had to add things again and again while learning some things so i don't like how it look, now with how i see things this project seems really bad.
At least i learned and that's what's important.
I think i'll look into Maven and Spring after this or i don't know maybe i'll have another project for my formation really quickly.
